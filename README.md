# Getting Started with CRACO

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) but now uses [CRACO](https://github.com/dilanx/craco), to allow the developer
to specify Babel plugin required to support ESM version of Veramo.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\

### `yarn run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
